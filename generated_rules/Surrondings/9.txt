1. If height = Tall and complexity = High and surroundings = Urban, then distance = Very Long Shot and moving = Moving Aerial Pan Shot.
2. If height = Tall and complexity = High and surroundings = Suburban, then distance = Medium Shot and moving = Moving Aerial Tilt Shot.
3. If height = Tall and complexity = High and surroundings = Natural, then distance = Medium Shot and moving = Bird's-eye Shot.

4. If height = Tall and complexity = Medium and surroundings = Urban, then distance = Medium Shot and moving = Bird's-eye Shot.
5. If height = Tall and complexity = Medium and surroundings = Suburban, then distance = Medium Shot and moving = Moving Aerial Pan Shot.
6. If height = Tall and complexity = Medium and surroundings = Natural, then distance = Very Long Shot and moving = Survey Shot.

7. If height = Tall and complexity = Low and surroundings = Urban, then distance = Medium Shot and moving = Pedestal/Elevator Shot.
8. If height = Tall and complexity = Low and surroundings = Suburban, then distance = Close-up and moving = Moving Aerial Tilt Shot.
9. If height = Tall and complexity = Low and surroundings = Natural, then distance = Very Long Shot and moving = Fly-through Shot.

10. If height = Medium and complexity = High and surroundings = Urban, then distance = Medium Shot and moving = Survey Shot.
