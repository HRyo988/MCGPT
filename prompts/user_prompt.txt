Analyze 10 frames from each video to infer the buildingâ€™s features, such as height, complexity, and surroundings. 
Based on these features, recommend the best combination of shooting parameters based on the building features and 4.Rules.

1. **Building Features**:
   - **Height**: Tall, Medium, Short.
   - **Complexity**: High (complex), Medium, Low (simple).
   - **Surroundings**: Urban, Suburban, Natural.

2. **Distance**: Choose from: Close-up, Medium Shot, Very Long Shot.

3. **Movement**: Choose from: Moving Aerial Pan Shot, Moving Aerial Tilt Shot, Pedestal/Elevator Shot, Bird's-eye Shot, Moving bird's-eye Shot, Survey Shot, Fly-through Shot.

4. **Rules**:
   - If height = Medium and complexity =  High and surroundings =  Natural, then distance =  Very Long Shot and moving =  Bird's-eye Shot.
   - If height = Medium and complexity =  High and surroundings =  Suburban, then distance =  Medium Shot and moving =  Moving Aerial Pan Shot.
   - If height = Medium and complexity =  High and surroundings =  Urban, then distance =  Medium Shot and moving =  Moving Aerial Tilt Shot.
   - If height = Medium and complexity =  Low and surroundings =  Natural, then distance =  Very Long Shot and moving =  Fly-through Shot.
   - If height = Medium and complexity =  Low and surroundings =  Suburban, then distance =  Very Long Shot and moving =  Bird's-eye Shot.
   - If height = Medium and complexity =  Low and surroundings =  Urban, then distance =  Medium Shot and moving =  Moving Aerial Tilt Shot.
   - If height = Medium and complexity =  Medium and surroundings =  Natural, then distance =  Medium Shot and moving =  Survey Shot.
   - If height = Medium and complexity =  Medium and surroundings =  Suburban, then distance =  Medium Shot and moving =  Moving Aerial Pan Shot.
   - If height = Medium and complexity =  Medium and surroundings =  Urban, then distance =  Medium Shot and moving =  Survey Shot.
   - If height = Short and complexity =  High and surroundings =  Natural, then distance =  Medium Shot and moving =  Fly-through Shot.
   - If height = Short and complexity =  High and surroundings =  Suburban, then distance =  Close-up and moving =  Moving Aerial Tilt Shot.
   - If height = Short and complexity =  High and surroundings =  Urban, then distance =  Close-up and moving =  Pedestal/Elevator Shot.
   - If height = Short and complexity =  Low and surroundings =  Natural, then distance =  Medium Shot and moving =  Bird's-eye Shot.
   - If height = Short and complexity =  Low and surroundings =  Suburban, then distance =  Close-up and moving =  Moving Aerial Tilt Shot.
   - If height = Short and complexity =  Low and surroundings =  Urban, then distance =  Close-up and moving =  Survey Shot.
   - If height = Short and complexity =  Medium and surroundings =  Natural, then distance =  Medium Shot and moving =  Moving bird's-eye Shot.
   - If height = Short and complexity =  Medium and surroundings =  Suburban, then distance =  Close-up and moving =  Survey Shot.
   - If height = Short and complexity =  Medium and surroundings =  Urban, then distance =  Close-up and moving =  Moving Aerial Pan Shot.
   - If height = Tall and complexity =  High and surroundings =  Natural, then distance =  Very Long Shot and moving =  Bird's-eye Shot.
   - If height = Tall and complexity =  High and surroundings =  Suburban, then distance =  Medium Shot and moving =  Moving Aerial Tilt Shot.
   - If height = Tall and complexity =  High and surroundings =  Urban, then distance =  Medium Shot and moving =  Moving Aerial Pan Shot.
   - If height = Tall and complexity =  Low and surroundings =  Natural, then distance =  Very Long Shot and moving =  Fly-through Shot.
   - If height = Tall and complexity =  Low and surroundings =  Suburban, then distance =  Very Long Shot and moving =  Bird's-eye Shot.
   - If height = Tall and complexity =  Low and surroundings =  Urban, then distance =  Medium Shot and moving =  Survey Shot.
   - If height = Tall and complexity =  Medium and surroundings =  Natural, then distance =  Very Long Shot and moving =  Moving bird's-eye Shot.
   - If height = Tall and complexity =  Medium and surroundings =  Suburban, then distance =  Medium Shot and moving =  Moving Aerial Pan Shot.
   - If height = Tall and complexity =  Medium and surroundings =  Urban, then distance =  Medium Shot and moving =  Pedestal/Elevator Shot.

**Step 1**: Extract building features (height, complexity, surroundings) from the frames.
**Step 2**: Based on the building features extracted and 4.Rules, recommend the best combination of shooting parameters.

Output only "distance <selected 2.Distance>" and "moving <selected 3.Movement>", excluding the process.
