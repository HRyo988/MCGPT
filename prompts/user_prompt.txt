Analyze the provided frames from each video to infer the buildingâ€™s characteristics, such as height, complexity, and surroundings. Based on these characteristics, recommend the best combination of shooting parameters (`distance` and `moving`). Then, convert your recommendations into machine-readable "if-then" rules.

1. **Extract building features**: Identify height (tall, medium, short), complexity (complex, medium, simple), and surroundings (urban, suburban, natural).
2. **Generate a natural language rule**: Example: "If the building is tall, complex, and in an urban setting, use a Moving Aerial Pan shot from a medium distance."
3. **Convert to machine-readable format**: Automatically convert the rule into an "if-then" structure. Example: `If height = <Height> and complexity = <complexity> and surroundings = <surroundings>, then distance = <selected distance> and moving = <selected movement>.`
4. **Optimize**: Ensure the rules are consistent, non-redundant, and cover all 27 combinations.

Respond in the following format:

    "Rules": "<Generated rules in if-then format for all combinations of building characteristics>",
    "Shot details of all videos": {
        "video name": "<referenced video name>",
        "Preferred shot combination": {
            "distance": "<selected distance>",
            "moving": "<selected movement>"
        }
    }
