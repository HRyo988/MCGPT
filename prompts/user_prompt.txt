Analyze 10 frames from each video to infer the buildingâ€™s features, such as height, complexity. 
Based on these features, recommend the best combination of shooting parameters based on the building features and 4.Rules.

1. **Building Features**:
   - Height: Tall, Medium, Short.
   - Complexity: High (complex), Medium, Low (simple).

2. **Distance**: Choose from: Close-up, Medium Shot, Very Long Shot.

3. **Movement**: Choose from: Moving Aerial Pan Shot, Moving Aerial Tilt Shot, Pedestal/Elevator Shot, Bird's-eye Shot, Moving bird's-eye Shot, Survey Shot, Fly-through Shot.

4. **Rules**:
   - If height = Tall and complexity = High, then distance = Very Long Shot and moving = Moving Aerial Pan Shot.
   - If height = Tall and complexity = Medium, then distance = Medium Shot and moving = Moving Aerial Tilt Shot.
   - If height = Tall and complexity = Low, then distance = Close-up and moving = Pedestal/Elevator Shot.
   - If height = Medium and complexity = High, then (distance = Medium Shot and moving = Pedestal/Elevator Shot) or (distance = Close-upand moving = Fly-through Shot) or (distance = Medium Shot and moving = Fly-through Shot) or (distance = Medium Shot and moving = Survey Shot).
   - If height = Medium and complexity = Medium, then distance = Medium Shot and moving = Pedestal/Elevator Shot.
   - If height = Medium and complexity = Low, then distance = Close-up and moving = Survey Shot.
   - If height = Short and complexity = High, then distance = Medium Shot and moving = Moving bird's-eye Shot.
   - If height = Short and complexity = Medium, then (distance = Close-up and moving = Fly-through Shot) or (distance = Medium Shot and moving = Fly-through Shot).
   - If height = Short and complexity = Low, then distance = Very Long Shot and moving = Bird's-eye Shot.

**Step 1**: Extract building features (height, complexity) from the frames.
**Step 2**: Based on the building features extracted and 4.Rules, recommend the best combination of shooting parameters.

Output only "distance <selected 2.Distance>" and "moving <selected 3.Movement>", excluding the process.
