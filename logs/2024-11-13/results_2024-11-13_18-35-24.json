        "system_prompt": "You are an expert in video analysis, identifying building types, sizes, and visual features from a series of frames. Each video has 10 frames, capturing the subject from different angles and distances. Your task is to analyze these frames and recommend the best combination of shooting parameters based on the building’s features, converting them into machine-readable \"if-then\" rules.\n\n1. **Building Features**:\n   - **Height**: Tall, Medium, Short.\n   - **Complexity**: High (complex), Medium, Low (simple).\n   - **Surroundings**: Urban, Suburban, Natural.\n\n2. **Distance**: Choose from:\n   - **Close-up**: The object is prominently featured and details are captured excellently, but this close distance limits any contextual background, focusing solely on fine features of the object.\n   - **Medium Shot**: The object is centered and fills more of the frame, providing a good balance between highlighting the object and maintaining some background context, though it may not capture precise details as closely as desired.\n   - **Very Long Shot**: The object appears small with ample space around it, offering a strong sense of context and environment, however, the details of the object itself are not clearly visible due to the distance.\n\n3. **Movement**: Choose from:\n   - **Moving Aerial Pan Shot**: The camera is set at a high angle facing the object and moves steadily from left to right.\n   - **Moving Aerial Tilt Shot**: The camera is positioned at a high angle above the object and moves vertically upward to capture the object from an overlooking perspective.\n   - **Pedestal/Elevator Shot**: The camera is set at a mid-height and frontal angle to the object and moves from a low position upward to a higher position.\n   - **Bird's-eye Shot**: The camera is set at a high altitude and is directly overhead the object, slowly zooming out for a wider view.\n   - **Moving bird's-eye Shot**: The camera is set at a high, top-down angle to the subject and moves slightly upward while focusing on the center.\n   - **Survey Shot**: The camera is set at a high angle to the subject, slightly off to the left from the front, and moves forward.\n   - **Fly-through Shot**: The camera is set at a straight-on angle to the object and moves from far to near, passing through it.\n\n**Step 1**: Extract building features (height, complexity, surroundings) from the frames.\n\n**Step 2**: Generate a natural language rule based on the building’s features.\n\n**Step 3**: Convert the natural language rule into an \"if-then\" structure.\n\n**Step 4**: Optimize the rules to cover all 27 combinations of building features.\n\nRespond only rules generated: <\"Rules\": \"<Generated Machine-readable \"if-then\" Rules for all 27 combinations of building features>\">\nExample:\nMachine-readable \"if-then\" Rules: `If height = <1.Height> and complexity = <1.complexity> and surroundings = <1.surroundings>, then distance = <selected 2.Distance> and moving = <selected 3.Movement>.`",

        "output": "I'm sorry, but I can't generate specific rules without analyzing the images directly. However, I can guide you on how to create such rules based on the criteria you've provided. Here's a general approach on how you might set up your \"if-then\" rules:\n\n```plaintext\nMachine-readable \"if-then\" Rules:\n\n1. If height = Tall and complexity = High and surroundings = Urban, then distance = Very Long Shot and moving = Moving Aerial Pan Shot.\n2. If height = Tall and complexity = High and surroundings = Suburban, then distance = Medium Shot and moving = Moving Aerial Tilt Shot.\n3. If height = Tall and complexity = High and surroundings = Natural, then distance = Close-up and moving = Survey Shot.\n4. If height = Tall and complexity = Medium and surroundings = Urban, then distance = Medium Shot and moving = Bird's-eye Shot.\n5. If height = Tall and complexity = Medium and surroundings = Suburban, then distance = Very Long Shot and moving = Moving bird's-eye Shot.\n6. If height = Tall and complexity = Medium and surroundings = Natural, then distance = Close-up and moving = Fly-through Shot.\n7. If height = Tall and complexity = Low and surroundings = Urban, then distance = Medium Shot and moving = Moving Aerial Pan Shot.\n8. If height = Tall and complexity = Low and surroundings = Suburban, then distance = Very Long Shot and moving = Moving Aerial Tilt Shot.\n9. If height = Tall and complexity = Low and surroundings = Natural, then distance = Close-up and moving = Pedestal/Elevator Shot.\n10. If height = Medium and complexity = High and surroundings = Urban, then distance = Very Long Shot and moving = Moving Aerial Pan Shot.\n11. If height = Medium and complexity = High and surroundings = Suburban, then distance = Medium Shot and moving = Survey Shot.\n12. If height = Medium and complexity = High and surroundings = Natural, then distance = Close-up and moving = Moving bird's-eye Shot.\n13. If height = Medium and complexity = Medium and surroundings = Urban, then distance = Very Long Shot and moving = Moving Aerial Tilt Shot.\n14. If height = Medium and complexity = Medium and surroundings = Suburban, then distance = Medium Shot and moving = Bird's-eye Shot.\n15. If height = Medium and complexity = Medium and surroundings = Natural, then distance = Close-up and moving = Fly-through Shot.\n16. If height = Medium and complexity = Low and surroundings = Urban, then distance = Very Long Shot and moving = Moving Aerial Pan Shot.\n17. If height = Medium and complexity = Low and surroundings = Suburban, then distance = Medium Shot and moving = Moving Aerial Tilt Shot.\n18. If height = Medium and complexity = Low and surroundings = Natural, then distance = Close-up and moving = Moving bird's-eye Shot.\n19. If height = Short and complexity = High and surroundings = Urban, then distance = Very Long Shot and moving = Moving Aerial Tilt Shot.\n20. If height = Short and complexity = High and surroundings = Suburban, then distance = Medium Shot and moving = Bird's-eye Shot.\n21. If height = Short and complexity = High and surroundings = Natural, then distance = Close-up and moving = Pedestal/Elevator Shot.\n22. If height = Short and complexity = Medium and surroundings = Urban, then distance = Very Long Shot and moving = Moving Aerial Pan Shot.\n23. If height = Short and complexity = Medium and surroundings = Suburban, then distance = Medium Shot and moving = Survey Shot.\n24. If height = Short and complexity = Medium and surroundings = Natural, then distance = Close-up and moving = Fly-through Shot.\n25. If height = Short and complexity = Low and surroundings = Urban, then distance = Very Long Shot and moving = Moving bird's-eye Shot.\n26. If height = Short and complexity = Low and surroundings = Suburban, then distance = Medium Shot and moving = Moving Aerial Tilt Shot.\n27. If height = Short and complexity = Low and surroundings = Natural, then distance = Close-up and moving = Pedestal/Elevator Shot.\n```\n\nThese rules are examples to illustrate the structure.
