Your task is to analyze these frames and recommend the best combination of shooting parameters based on the building’s characteristics, converting them into machine-readable \"if-then\" rules.\n\n1. **Distance**: Choose from:\n   - **Close-up**: Subject occupies less than 12.5% of the screen.\n   - **Medium**: Subject occupies approximately 50% of the screen.\n   - **Very Far**: Subject occupies over 87.5% of the screen.\n\n2. **Movement**: Choose from:\n   - **Moving Aerial Pan Shot**: Camera moves left or right in the air.\n   - **Moving Aerial Tilt Shot**: Camera tilts up and down.\n   - **Pedestal/Elevator Shot**: Camera moves up and down.\n   - **Bird's-eye shot**: Camera looks down on the subject.\n   - **Moving bird's-eye shot**: Camera moves horizontally while looking down.\n   - **Survey Shot**: Wide, still shot of a landscape.\n   - **Fly-through shot**: Camera moves through an object or space.\n\n3. **Building Characteristics**:\n   - **Height**: Tall, Medium, Short.\n   - **Complexity**: High (complex), Medium, Low (simple).\n   - **Surroundings**: Urban, Suburban, Natural.\n\n**Step 1**: Extract building features (height, complexity, surroundings) from the frames.\n\n**Step 2**: Generate a natural language rule based on the building’s characteristics.\n\n**Step 3**: Convert the natural language rule into an \"if-then\" structure.\n\nExample:\nNatural Language Rule: \"If the building is <Height>, <complexity>, and in <surroundings>, use <selected movement> from <selected distance>.\"\nMachine-readable rule: `If height = <Height> and complexity = <complexity> and surroundings = <surroundings>, then distance = <selected distance> and moving = <selected movement>.`\n\n**Step 4**: Optimize the rules to cover all 27 combinations of building characteristics.\n\nRespond with the rules and shot details for each video in the following JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Rules\": \"<Generated rules in if-then format for all combinations of building characteristics>\",\n    \"Shot details of all videos\": {\n        \"video name\": \"<referenced video name>\",\n        \"Preferred shot combination\": {\n            \"distance\": \"<selected distance>\",\n            \"moving\": \"<selected movement>\"\n        }\n    }\n}",

Based on these characteristics, recommend the best combination of shooting parameters (`distance` and `moving`). Then, convert your recommendations into machine-readable \"if-then\" rules.\n\n1. **Extract building features**: Identify height (tall, medium, short), complexity (complex, medium, simple), and surroundings (urban, suburban, natural).\n2. **Generate a natural language rule**: Example: \"If the building is tall, complex, and in an urban setting, use a Moving Aerial Pan shot from a medium distance.\"\n3. **Convert to machine-readable format**: Automatically convert the rule into an \"if-then\" structure. Example: `If height = <Height> and complexity = <complexity> and surroundings = <surroundings>, then distance = <selected distance> and moving = <selected movement>.`\n4. **Optimize**: Ensure the rules are consistent, non-redundant, and cover all 27 combinations.\n\nRespond in the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Rules\": \"<Generated rules in if-then format for all combinations of building characteristics>\",\n    \"Shot details of all videos\": {\n        \"video name\": \"<referenced video name>\",\n        \"Preferred shot combination\": {\n            \"distance\": \"<selected distance>\",\n            \"moving\": \"<selected movement>\"\n        }\n    }\n}",
