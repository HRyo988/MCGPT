However, judging by the provided image, you could extract height and complexity features yourself.\n\nOnce you do that, you can apply the appropriate rules to find the best shooting parameters. Here's how you can proceed:\n\n1. **Extract Building Features** (manually from the image):\n   - **Height**: Determine if the building is Tall, Medium, or Short.\n   - **Complexity**: Determine if the building design is High, Medium, or Low in complexity.\n\n2. **Apply Shooting Rules**:\n   - Match the features to the given rules to determine the best shot type.\n\nYou can share your observations, and I'd be happy to help further!"
